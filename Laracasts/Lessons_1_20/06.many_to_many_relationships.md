Many-to-Many Relationships
==========================

[environment/many2manyRel](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Laracasts/tree/environment/many2manyRel)

Many-to-Many relationships can be described as a table relationships that share
a common feature that is related in many aspects. For example, a lesson can have
many tags. So can tags have many lessons. If both can have many of each other,
then they are many to many. In this lesson, we execute a few commands to get the
ball rolling on our code.

First we create a model of `Lesson` and `Tag`. We then created a migration with
three different migrations --the first two allow us to import a lesson and tag
table with a few properties relating to its name. Next, we create a pivot
migration.

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

class PivotLessonTagTable extends Migration {

	/**
	 * Run the migrations.
	 *
	 * @return void
	 */
	public function up()
	{
		Schema::create('lesson_tag', function(Blueprint $table) {
			$table->increments('id');
			$table->integer('lesson_id')->unsigned()->index();
			$table->integer('tag_id')->unsigned()->index();
			$table->foreign('lesson_id')->references('id')->on('lessons')->onDelete('cascade');
			$table->foreign('tag_id')->references('id')->on('tags')->onDelete('cascade');
		});
	}



	/**
	 * Reverse the migrations.
	 *
	 * @return void
	 */
	public function down()
	{
		Schema::drop('lesson_tag');
	}

}
```

Notice, that our pivot migration creates a new table with a normal incremental
identifier as well as a lesson and tag identifier. These will be then used in
the foreign columns that references the `lesson_id` and `tag_id` which in turn
references their respective identifiers on lessons and tags table. This is very
simple as it creates a foreign key that links both identifiers with a pivot
table. By creating our many-to-many relationship this way, we can organize the
way relationships are handled.

Next, after migrating all the tables into our database, we go ahead and start
creating identical functions inside our models that allow us to define how
lessons belong to tags and visa versa.

This simple call will return the object's belong to, which will be linked to the
pivot table we created earlier. 

```php
<?php

class Tag extends Eloquent {
	protected $guarded = array();

	public static $rules = array();

	public function lessons()
	{
		return $this->belongsToMany('Lesson');
	}
}
```

```php
<?php

class Lesson extends Eloquent {
	protected $guarded = array();

	public static $rules = array();

	public function tags()
	{
		return $this->belongsToMany('Tag');
	}
}
```

Lastly, we start returning the data.

We can grab one lesson, which Eloquent will find in our database. We then return
that find in a lesson variable. An object which has access to the tags method is
returned. We are essentially telling Laravel to find lessons that belong to
tags. That is, lessons who have linked to the tags table via pivot.

```php
<?php 
Route::get('/', function()
{
	$lesson = Lesson::find(1);
	$tag = Tag::find(1);
	return $tag->lessons;

	return $lesson->tags;
	// alternatively, 
	return $lessons->tags()->get(); // if you want to continue changing.
});

Route::get('/', function()
{
	// DB::table('lesson_tag')->insert([
	// 	['lesson_id' => 1, 'tag_id' => 1],
	// 	['lesson_id' => 1, 'tag_id' => 2],
	// 	['lesson_id' => 1, 'tag_id' => 3],
	// 	['lesson_id' => 2, 'tag_id' => 1],
	// 	['lesson_id' => 2, 'tag_id' => 3],
	// ]);
    //
	$lesson = Lesson::first();

	$lesson->tags()->attach(2);

	return $lesson->tags;
});
```


Coming to a close, we can grab the first lesson and attach a number. That number
will attach a value of tag to the lesson. That is, the first lesson entry will
be linked to tag 2. Thanks to the attach method, it allows us to easily call and
attach a tag number dynamically. We return the result to view. 


Remember, all pivot table entries are entered manually. But we can attach them
through a simple call.
