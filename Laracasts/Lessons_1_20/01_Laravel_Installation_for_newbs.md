Laravel Intallation for newbs
=============================

Installation: `composer-project laravel/laravel <name_of_folder> --prefer-dist`

Make sure you instal dependency manager called composer as a global tool in your
terminal.

Within your `composer.json` file, it's best to include `require_dev` environment
option in yout JSON so that you can include Jeffrey Way's Plugin on the
development process and not have it uploaded to your main application in
production.
